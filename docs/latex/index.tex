This is a generic implementation of {\ttfamily then} for C++14, allowing you to chain together futures, promises and so forth easily and efficiently.

\#\# Example\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 \{C++\}
2 #include "thenable.hpp"
3 
4 #include <iostream>
5 #include <chrono>
6 #include <thread>
7 #include <assert.h>
8 
9 using namespace std;
10 using namespace thenable;
11 
12 int main() \{
13     ThenablePromise<int> p, k;
14 
15     cout << "Starting asynchronous tasks on thread: " << this\_thread::get\_id() << endl;
16 
17     p.then( [&k]( int i ) \{
18         assert( i == 10 );
19 
20         cout << "Hello, World! from thread: " << this\_thread::get\_id() << endl;
21 
22         k.set\_value( 421 );
23 
24         return k.get\_future();
25 
26     \} ).then( []( int i ) \{
27         assert( i = 421 );
28 
29         cout << "Hello, again! from thread: " << this\_thread::get\_id() << endl;
30 
31     \}, then\_launch::detached );
32 
33     //Launch a new thread to resolve the original promise.
34     thread( [&p] \{
35         cout << "Resolving promise on thread: " << this\_thread::get\_id() << endl;
36 
37         p.set\_value( 10 );
38     \} ).join();
39 
40     //Just to keep the program alive long enough for the promises/futures to propagate.
41     this\_thread::sleep\_for( 10s );
42 
43     return 0;
44 \}
\end{DoxyCode}


The output of the above will be something like\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 Starting asynchronous tasks on thread: 1
2 Resolving promise on thread: 4
3 Hello, World! from thread: 2
4 Hello, again! from thread: 3
\end{DoxyCode}


If {\ttfamily T\+H\+E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+D\+E\+F\+A\+U\+L\+T\+\_\+\+P\+O\+L\+I\+CY} is set to {\ttfamily std\+::launch\+::deferred}, then the last two actions will be performed on the same thread.

\subsection*{Dependencies}

This project relies on files from my {\ttfamily function\+\_\+traits} project located here\+: \href{https://github.com/novacrazy/function_traits}{\tt function\+\_\+traits}.

Clone the repo or download a Z\+IP of it and add the {\ttfamily \textquotesingle{}include\textquotesingle{}} directory to your build system.

For example, to add it to {\ttfamily C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt} you would do this\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 include\_directories(
2     SYSTEM
3     "/path/to/function\_traits/include"
4     "/path/to/thenable/include"
5 )
\end{DoxyCode}
